# Glyiff
 A light web app for adding captions to GIFs.

Using the [Gifler library](https://themadcreator.github.io/gifler/) by Bill Dwyer to draw an animated GIF to an HTML canvas, Glyiff provides an intuitive user interface to customize uploaded GIFs in various ways, such as by...

- Adding a custom caption (with automatic word-wrapping!) at the top.
- Providing options for font styles and weights.
- Allowing the user to pick a text color for their caption.
- Updating the GIF in real time, as text is edited in the text box.
